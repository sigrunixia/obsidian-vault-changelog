# Obsidian Vault Changelog Plugin

A plugin to maintain a change log of recently edited files in your Obsidian vault. Updates can be triggered manually or automatically.

## Features

- Tracks recently edited notes in a centralized changelog.
- Supports both manual and automatic updates.
- Customizable file paths, timestamps, and entry limits.

## Important

⚠️ **The change log note is entirely overwritten at each update.**  
Use a dedicated change log note and embed it elsewhere if you need historical tracking.
